# quick_family_messages
Automatically send 'personalized' messages to my parents and siblings (via FB messenger)

Parents subtly nagged at me earlier today for "being too busy" during the week to talk to them"

Timezone difference (12-14 hours depending on Daylight Savings) makes it difficult to keep track 

_"It's a pandemic what are you even doing"_ 


- Timezone can be adjusted according to where presumably all family members are currently located
- Environment variables need to be set on local machine for login credentials as well as the registered FB Messenger names of desired recipients
- Messages can be manually added or edited 

Extensions:
1. After the first week, someone will notice the repetition -- create more template messages and then add a random template message selecting function
2. Move messages to a DB and draw from there?
